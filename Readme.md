## NoSQL
NoSQL has experienced significant popularity growth in te last few years, but what is it and how does it fit into the Sencha Stack?

NoSQL is a term generically and unofficially recognized as a representation of modern web-scale databases. In simple terms, they're
data stores designed for a particular purpose, predominantly cutting edge web applications. You'll find NoSQL used in some of the 
largest sites on the web, including YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and many others.

At a high level, NoSQL data stores commonly share a few traits. They are typically schemaless by nature, though this doesn't constrain
you from using a framework or schema implementation of your own (such as MongooseJS).
